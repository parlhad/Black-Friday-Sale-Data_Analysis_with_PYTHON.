## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Black Friday Sales dataset. The primary goal is to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify trends across different demographics (gender, age, occupation), and extract insights that can help businesses optimize their sales strategies.

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of sales across different **Genders**.
- Identify which **Age Groups** contribute the most to the total purchase amount.
- Explore the relationship between **Marital Status** and spending habits.
- Determine the most popular **Product Categories** and **City Categories**.
- Provide actionable insights for inventory and marketing management.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and analysis.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset typically contains several features including:
- `User_ID`: Unique ID of the customer.
- `Product_ID`: Unique ID of the product.
- `Gender`: M/F.
- `Age`: Age bins (e.g., 0-17, 18-25, etc.).
